		/* 
		 FFT routine, (C)1996 S.M.Bernsee. Sign = -1 is FFT, 1 is iFFT (inverse)
		 Fills data[0...2*fftFrameSize-1] with the Fourier transform of the
		 time domain data in data[0...2*fftFrameSize-1]. The FFT array takes
		 and returns the cosine and sine parts in an interleaved manner, ie.
		 data[0] = cosPart[0], data[1] = sinPart[0], asf. fftFrameSize
		 must be a power of 2. It expects a complex input signal (see footnote 2),
		 ie. when working with 'common' audio signals our input signal has to be
		 passed as {in[0],0.,in[1],0.,in[2],0.,...} asf. In that case, the transform
		 of the frequencies of interest is in data[0...fftFrameSize].
